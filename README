#Ping Pong
####Modded by Cheenar
<p>I found a very simple pong game written in Java and began to modify it. Currently the only changes are small and to the core of the game. I plan on adding a network module and expanding the game.</p>
<p>This project is completely open-source and avaiable to anyone to reuse for whatever purpose. The original owner <b>Luca Wehrstedt</b> included the <i>GNU General Public License</i>.
